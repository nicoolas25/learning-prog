# Now that we know how to represent some information.
# Here is how to name these informations.

# `person` is a variable and its value is "Alice".

person = "Bob"
# `person` has now "Bob" as value. The value "Alice" is now lost.

#
# Variables are usually used to reference different things over time.
# Sometime the value of a variable never changes. In this case, we called it
# a constant.
